bootstrap-stylus
================

Port of Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.1 to Stylus.

This version does not have any dependencies on nib.

There might be some slight color differences due to the differences between the color functions in less and those in Stylus.

- Compile bootstrap.styl to get the basic stylesheet.
- Compile responsive.styl to get the additional responsive stylesheet.
